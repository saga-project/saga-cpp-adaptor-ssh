:DESCRIPTION:

 The SSH file adaptor allows remote file access to ssh backends.  That is
 implemented by mounting the remote file system via sshfs, and then forwarding
 all file operations to the local file adaptor (URLs are just translated into
 that mounted namespace transparently).  Thus, the ssh file adaptor depends
 crucially on the local file adaptor.


:CHANGELOG:

  - initial version


:REQUIRES:

  All ssh adaptors require the ssh and scp command line tools.  If those are not
  found in the path, configure can be told about alternative locations.  The ssh
  file adaptor additionally requires fuse/sshfs to be installed, and the FUSE
  module to be loaded into the kernel.  See INFO file for the ssh proxy adaptor
  for some more details.


:CONFIGURE OPTIONS:

  | --with-ssh              path to ssh   binary [default=check] |\\
  | --with-scp              path to scp   binary [default=check] |\\
  | --with-sshfs            path to sshfs binary [default=check] |\\
  

:INI OPTIONS:

  At the moment, SAGA does not allow to (easily) share ini options between
  adaptors.  Thus, all ssh ini options are actually replicated between all ini
  adaptors - this will be fixed at some point.  Up to then, however, the ini
  documentation of the ssh context adaptor will cover the ini settings for *all*
  ssh adaptors.

  Additionally, the file adaptor supports two additional ini keys:

  |sshfs_mnt       = ${HOME}/.saga/adaptors/ssh/ssh_file/mnt/|
  |sshfs_keepalive = yes|

  |sshfs_mnt| sets the mount root for the sshfs fuse mount operations, and
  |sshfs_keepalive| determines if the mounted sshfs filesystems should stay
  mounted after adaptor destructions.
