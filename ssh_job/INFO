:DESCRIPTION:

 The SSH job adaptor allows to run jobs on ssh backends.  These jobs are started
 via the ssh command line client.  That in turn is started via the local job
 adaptor.  Thus, the ssh job adaptor depends crucially on the local job adaptor.


:CHANGELOG:

  - initial version


:REQUIRES:

  All ssh adaptors require the ssh and scp command line tools.  If those are not
  found in the path, configure can be told about alternative locations.  See
  INFO file for the ssh proxy adaptor for some more details.


:CONFIGURE OPTIONS:

  | --with-ssh              path to ssh   binary [default=check] |\\
  | --with-scp              path to scp   binary [default=check] |\\
  | --with-sshfs            path to sshfs binary [default=check] |\\
  

:INI OPTIONS:

  At the moment, SAGA does not allow to (easily) share ini options between
  adaptors.  Thus, all ssh ini options are actually replicated between all ini
  adaptors - this will be fixed at some point.  Up to then, however, the ini
  documentation of the ssh context adaptor will cover the ini settings for *all*
  ssh adaptors.  Additional ini options are described below.

  - |ssh_test_remote| (default=true)\\ This flag enables additional tests for
  hostname validity and executable existence.  These tests SHOULD be enabled,
  but are time consuming -- so this flag allows to disable them.
