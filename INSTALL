             <http://www.saga-project.org/download/adaptors/ssh>


  For detailed informations on how to install SAGA, please refer 
  to the documentation section on our website:

    http://www.saga-project.org/documentation 


  PREREQUISISTES:
  
  o SAGA Core Components
    You have to install the SAGA Core Components before you can install the
    Python Bindings. The Core Components are available on the SAGA website.

  o Boost C++ Libraries >= 1.33
    You need to have the Boost C++ libraries installed on your system. Many
    systems already provide binary packages for them. If your system doesn't 
    you can download the source from http://www.boost.org and build it yourself.
    
  o ssh command line tools
    The ssh adaptors all need ssh and scp, the ssh_file adaptor also needs
    sshfs.  Note that sshfs in turn needs fuse to be installed and enabled in
    order to function properly.

    If the ssh command line tools are not in your path, you can tell configure
    where to find them, with the following options:

    
 
  BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE SSH ADAPTORS
 
  The SSH Adaptors come with a configure/make-based buildsystem. There are 
  some useful options for ./configure:

    --boost-location=       The location of your Boost installation
                            (e.g. /usr/local/packages/boost-1.42). You only
                            need this option if boost is *not* installed in
                            the default path (/usr/ or /usr/local

      --with-ssh=           The paths to the ssh command line tools, in case 
      --with-scp=           those cannot be found by configure via your  
      --with-sshfs=         PATH environment,

  For a complete list of configure options, you can type

    ./configure --help
 
  To configure, build and install the SSH Adaptors, make sure that 
  $SAGA_LOCATION points to your SAGA Core Components installation and
  execute ./configure and make:

    $> export SAGA_LOCATION=/PATH/TO/SAGA_CORE_INSTALLATION
    $> ./configure --with-boost=/BOOST/DIR/ --with-ssh=/PATH/TO/SSH ...
    $> make
    $> make install


  Please help us to improve the quality of SAGA and file a bug report if you 
  have encountered any problems with the build system. Our bug-tracking system
